# Monkeynauts
Raster Asteroids clone made (almost) entirely in Monkey2.
The project was written using the default Monkey2 IDE, Ted2Go, and is mainly just an experiment with the language as I still get on my feet.  

Beware, as the code you may find ahead can (and possibly will) be ugly, inconsistent and absolutely not optimized! You have been warned!
